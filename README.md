# Changelog
 This changelog section, built using HTML and CSS, displays recent updates in a clean and visually appealing timeline format. The timeline includes key events, with each entry showing a date on the left and a corresponding event on the right. A vertical line passes through the center of circular dots, visually connecting all updates to maintain a structured flow. The section header highlights the purpose of the changelog, followed by a brief description of the updates. A call-to-action button at the bottom encourages users to view the complete changelog.  The design uses simple typography, balanced spacing, and subtle shadows to create a modern and professional look. The layout is responsive, ensuring a consistent experience across various screen sizes.
